PUB SUB OPERATIONS:-

⇒ SUSCRIBE → SUBSCRIBE <CHANNEL_NAME>

⇒ PUBLISH → PUBLISH <CHANNEL_NAME> <MESSAGE>

⇒ PSUBSCRIBE → PSUBSCRIBE <LETTER*> → SUBSCRIBE TO EVERY CHANNEL THAT STARTS WITH THAT PARTICULAT LETTER

⇒ UNSUBSCRIBE → UNSUBSCRIBE <CHANNEL_NAME>

⇒ PUNSUBSCRIBE → PUNSUBSCRIBE <LETTER*> → UNSUBSCRIBE TO EVERY CHANNEL THAT STARTS WITH THAT PARTICULAT LETTER

STREAM OPERATIONS

> Creates a Streamline type of structure for multiple users to be handled simultaneously

- XADD
    - XADD mystream 10000 name Rohit

        mystream → Stream name

        10000 → key { should be unique }

        name Rohit → key value pair 

    - XADD mystream * name Rohit

        Assigns an ID randomly - format is  TimeStamp-0

    - XADD mystream MAXLEN 10000 * name devs

        sets a limit { here 10000 } after which the entire dataset will reset and new data will act as the first data , this helps in limiting the size of data stored and avoid crashing due to overload

- XREAD
    - XREAD COUNT 200 STREAMS mystream 0

        basically reads the desired no of values starting from 0 { here 200 rows will be fetched }

    - XREAD COUNT 200 STREAMS mystream  100002-0

        Reads the values { Here 200 values } after the desired  specified id 

    - XREAD BLOCK  10000 STREAMS mystream 0

        closes the stream if no message is received after 10 sec  , it will automatically disconnect the user.

        To make the connection permanent , write 0 in place of time specifies ( 10000 → 0 )

    - XREAD BLOCK 10000 STREAMS mystream $

        gives a kind of PUB/SUB feature by making the connection active for 10 sec , otherwise it will disconnect.

        If it receives the data , it will display the data and close the connection.

    - XRANGE
        - XRANGE mystream <startID-0> <EndingID-0>

            Acts like a loop and returns the data within the given Start Id and End ID

        - XRANGE mystream <startID-0> <EndingID-0> COUNT 10

            Acts like a loop and returns the data within the given Start Id and End ID and returns the first 10 vaues from the start

        - XRANGE mystream - + COUNT 10

            Brings 10 values from the very beginning to the very last (basically upper bound)

        - XREVRANGE mystream + - COUNT 10

            Brings 10 values from the very last to the beginning (basically Lower bound)
